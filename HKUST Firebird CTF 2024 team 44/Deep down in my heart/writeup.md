What! It is obfuscated?! Legend has it that finding the original code is impossible!

If you feel dizzy, you can listen to [this](https://youtu.be/XpqqjU7u5Yc?si=sqkSGwilIn4CMg19)

[File](writeup/app-release.apk)

## Solution

Extract `lib/*/libnative-lib.so`. `*` is a wildcard standing for a folder of any name. There are 4 such files, and any one of them will work. Then open the library file in a text editor of your choice and search for `driberif`, the reverse of `firebird`. One should find `}3v0l_07_5r3gn4r75_0n_3r4_3w{driberif`. Reverse the text to get `firebird{w3_4r3_n0_57r4ng3r5_70_l0v3}`.

## Process

First, one should know that [`apk`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apk_(file_format)) is just another format using the ubiquitous [`zip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)). This is the case for quite a lot of file formats as no one is gonna reinvent the wheel and make their own archive format. Even if you do not know that, trying to extract the file as a `zip` first is a good idea in general. So unzip the file into a folder.

After the unzipping the file, you will find that the files inside are binary. Of course, that is because it is compiled. This should be easy if you know Java or Android development. Decompile the `apk` file with a decompiler (online decompilers are a Google search away).

Now where is the flag? The idea of searching for it directly is quickly killed by the fake flag `firebird{0f_c0z_1_w1ll_n0t_put_7h3_fl4g_h3r3)}`. You will also see this fake flag if you install the `apk` file. The fake flag does have one use though: Helping you to find the actual application code out of all those obfuscated Java files. The other obfuscated Java files are simply library files and you can just ignore them.

After finding the application code (or installing the `apk` file), you will find that it is a calculator app. One thing of interest is that the calculator uses [Java Native Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface) (JNI). JNI is basically a way to call native code from Java. The 4 JNI methods are named `jniADD`, `jniMUL`, `jniDIV`, `jniSUB`. If you review the name of this challenge, "Deep down in my heart", one may conjecture that the native code contains the flag. After all, native code is more "deep down" than Java, right?

The native code is located under `lib`. There are 4 folders: `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, `x86_64`. It is somewhat obvious from the name that each folder contains the exact same native code but compiled for different architectures, so you can choose any one of them. You will find a `so` file inside. A bit of Linux knowledge would tell you that the `so` file is a native library file, so that is where the native code is located.

Disassemble the `so` file. In this case, we used [IDA Free](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/#download). Now if you know a bit of JNI, you should know that the JNI methods have names formatted in the following way: `Java_(package name with dots replaced by underscores)_(Java method name)`. So search for symbols starting with `Java_`. One would find 5 functions instead of the expected 4, so the extra unused function is what we are interested in: `Java_com_x64m_xsfmnative_MainActivity_jniMSG`. Looking at the disassembly of the starting part of the function:

```assembly

One would notice that the assembly references some data containing interesting song lyrics. The most obvious one above is "Never gonna give you up", but the `unk_*` ones are also song lyrics references. The last step is to inspect the referenced text. In IDA, you can do so by `ctrl`-clicking the `aNeverGonnaGive`. Then start looking at the surrounding text. If you look long enough, you will eventually find something that looks like a flag:

Reading it gives `}3v0l_07_5r3gn4r75_0n_3r4_3w{driberif`. It should not be too difficult to notice that reversing it gives the flag. Reverse the text to get `firebird{w3_4r3_n0_57r4ng3r5_70_l0v3}`.

Unfortunately for us, we are a bit "too blind" as in the song lyrics. After some struggling, we opened the library file in a text editor and search for "Never gonna give you up" to find the reversed flag next to it. ðŸ«
