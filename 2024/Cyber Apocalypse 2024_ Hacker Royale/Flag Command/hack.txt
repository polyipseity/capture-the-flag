You abruptly find yourself lucid in the middle of a bizarre, alien forest.
How the hell did you end up here?
Eerie, indistinguishable sounds ripple through the gnarled trees, setting the hairs on your neck on edge.
Glancing around, you spot a gangly, grinning figure lurking in the shadows, muttering 'Xclow3n' like some sort of deranged mantra, clearly waiting for you to pass out or something. Creepy much?
Heads up! This forest isn't your grandmother's backyard.
It's packed with enough freaks and frights to make a horror movie blush. Time to find your way out.
The stakes? Oh, nothing big. Just your friends, plunged into an abyss of darkness and despair.
Punch in 'start' to kick things off in this twisted adventure!
